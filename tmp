### 1. The Strike Price Term: $Ke^{-rt}$

$$Ke^{-rt}$$

- $K$ = Strike price (the money you receive if you exercise)
- $e^{-rt}$ = **Discount factor** (converts future money to present value)
- $r$ = Risk-free interest rate (e.g., 5% = 0.05)
- $t$ = Time to expiration (in years)

**Intuition**: Money in the future is worth less than money today. If $K = 100$ and you receive it in 1 year at 5% interest, its present value is $100 \times e^{-0.05 \times 1} \approx 95.12$.

**Example**:
- Strike $K = \$100$
- Time $t = 0.25$ years (3 months)
- Rate $r = 0.05$
- Present value: $100 \times e^{-0.05 \times 0.25} = 100 \times 0.9876 = 98.76$
